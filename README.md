In this excersice I master how stateless components inherit from stateful components.

Careful explanation of the code and how it functions:

1. A stateful component class defines a function that calls this.setState. (Parent.js, lines 15-19)
2. The stateful component passes that function down to a stateless component. (Parent.js, line 24)
3. That stateless component class defines a function that calls the passed-down function, and that can take an event object as an argument. (Child.js, lines 10-13)
4. The stateless component class uses this new function as an event handler. (Child.js, line 20)
5. When an event is detected, the parentâ€™s state updates. (A user selects a new dropdown menu item)
6. The stateful component class passes down its state, distinct from the ability to change its state, to a different stateless component. (Parent.js, line 25)
7. That stateless component class receives the state and displays it. (Sibling.js, lines 5-10)
8. An instance of the stateful component class is rendered. One stateless child component displays the state, and a different stateless child component displays a way to change the (Parent.js, lines 23-26)
